# Error checking and data.
# This allows for a custom error return. Be it a print, function or other things.

# The code is attempted to be run
try:
  print(int(input("To Print")))

  #If there is an error / excemption, do this
except:
  print("An error has occured")

  # The Finally clause is code that runs regardless of an error or not
finally:
  print("The Code has been run")
